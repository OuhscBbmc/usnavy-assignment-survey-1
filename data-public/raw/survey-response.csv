Should we let the 06 with 25 years of service who is coming back from AFG have preference to go to San Diego (for example) when there is someone who is a better clinician educator who is more junior and not coming back from overseas???  No.  For GME programs we should give detailing preference to those who have shown a preference and propensity to be a good educator.  For other billets and when people are otherwise equal then sure, maybe we should give preference to seniority and those returning from OCONUS. 

Overall I'm a bit surprised we are trying to compare the detailing process to a residency match.  We are comparing a group of people (NRMP applicants) who are in all essential purposes unknowns other than stats on an application and comparing that to the detailing of a group of people who are known entity in other things than just FITREPS.  Maybe in large communities such as IM the Specialty Leader may not know everyone, but in the smaller communities the specialty leader absolutely knows the ""unknowns"" that can be a huge impact on the success of someone completing a tour somewhere.

If we want Navy Medicine to be a high reliability organization we need institutional memory.  It certainly isn't going to come from a CO/XO who rotates out after two years along with a revolving door of executive medicine leaders.  I can certainly see the gaining command's preference for this proposed system since they get much more of a say over who goes where.  If the problem is a lack of transparency at the Specialty Leader level then get new Specialty Leaders and mandate transparency.  We shouldn't pick and choose when we want to be special and not.  We can't claim that ""hey look at aviators and their requirements to make O6 so we shouldn't complain about promotion rates"" when later that week we are going to turn around and say ""hey we are special, we need a completely different detailing process.""

For instance I still have the email from my detailer when I was a LT that promised an ideal location in Europe if I stayed in a less desirable oconus billet. When he left and the new detailer came about, that deal was no longer valid. My choices were much less attractive than what was previously advertised. When I was able to leave the rules changed, and no oconus to oconus orders were available due to expense. However inexperienced newly graduated physicans went to Europe every year and colleagues at multiple commands were executing oconus to oconus orders each year. Being transparent about those situations would bring an element of trust when it appears there are hypocritical rules for some but not all. Finally yes, my family being required to move every 2-3 years while some above me have stayed at commands for over ten years appears unfair as well. I am happy that the Navy is considering changes.

A separate issue that comes up is that inexperienced individuals, specifically fresh out of residency doctors being sent to small commands with few deliveries/surgeries is dangerous to patients. They need some support or at least one or more senior doctors to help mentor their first years out.

There wasn't any discussion with the detailer or the specialty leader about my career progression or family situation.  The move has placed my family in financial hardship while my wife completes a college degree.  My wife could not move which has forced us to have to geographical bachelor for at least this year.  Also, this billet does not do anything for career progression.  I was in a billet with significant upward mobility.  I was a 1 out of 6 EP provider with high vis collaterals at a major MTF.  I was pulled out of these orders and sent to a first tour LT job where I will be a 1 of 1 on fitreps without an opportunity to deploy without my family.

In the civilian matching system, you have one or two days to impress a program (if you did not go to that medical school or completed a subI/rotation.)  So, for most of your interviews, the programs rank medical students based upon minimal exposure.  And, the attendings who rank the students will have rarely worked with that student if at all.  So, there is not much of an opportunity for nepotism to develop.  But, in the military, you are continually crossing paths with folks who will have influence to generate the command list.  So, I would not be surprised if that creates some institutionalizing.  For instance, folks surround themselves with other similar folks.  And, it potentially would be hard to ""break in"" to a new command should you want to move.  So, I see a multitude of IG complaints down the road.

Also, having gone through the civilian match, it is very angst provoking.  I suspect physicians would choose to leave active duty for the security of a well paying career without the hassle of an unknown PCS.  For instance, I knew about 16 months out I was penciled in to my next billet.  A year out, I knew that I was inked in.  Then, I had to wait 8 months for the PCS funding.  And, then had about 4 months to put my move together.  But, if I knew that I would go through a match a potentially get orders I wasn't thrilled about, I would probably chose the civilian sector.  Or, I would only put places I would be willing to go to and if I didn't match, then I would get out.  And, if the rules were to rank all duty stations, I would probably get out as soon as possible.

Our tailored, personalized approach results in a much more satisfied group of physicians. Hand-selecting individuals for billets allows the specialty leaders to make educated, strategic selections based upon years of data.  If you have one physician who has been a team-player throughout his or her career and volunteered for every duty or hardship, it would be a shame if a lazy, deployment-dodging counterpart got his or her billet preference because such realities were not evident in a more formulaic match system.  Our specialty leaders are chosen for a reason.  We expect them to be fair and honest and should afford them the ability to make their own informed decisions. 
Additionally, imposing term-limits on billets helps nobody.  Physicians who dedicate their entire career to the Navy should not be up-rooted just because of some arbitrary limit on the number of years someone says they should be in one location.  Finally, if the goal of such limits is to make officers uncomfortable to the point that they choose to the service, we should explore other options.  The Army is offering 15-year early retirements to assist with the draw-down.  This is a much more fair practice than jerking senior officers around with the goal of having them leave before retirement."172,I,8/23/16 9:00,4,en,8/23/16 8:36,8/23/16 9:00,Radiology,,LCDR,2016,,CONUS Operational,,2-4 months,,1,1,5,Other,I was asked to accept these orders by the Wing Surgeon and MEF Surgeon.

Implicit in this plan is the idea that every location is equally desirable, so a high performing officer is just as likely to list NH Lemoore first as they are to list NH Bremerton. Conventional wisdom would hold that this is not the case, and there are more desirable locations and less desirable locations. If all the highest ranked performers cluster at more desirable locations, it has the potential to create a quality imbalance among various Commands which may adversely impact Enterprise Mission Accomplishment. The difference between Navy Medicine Enterprise and the NRMP is that each institution in the NRMP is out to maximize its quality and has no concerns if other institutions have poorer quality trainees -- their imperative is to maximize quality at their ONE institution. The imperative for Navy Medicine Enterprise is to maintain quality ACROSS THE BOARD. Our aim should not be to create one or two very high performing Commands and a bunch of lower performing Commands. Our aim should be to create an environment where quality is maximized across all activities. This could be accomplished based on the precepts in the matching algorithm (i.e. -- the guideline might preclude the #1 and #2 ranked individuals from matching to the same location, even if they both ranked it #1 and there were billets available). 

Note: this is the argument for leaving the system the way it is -- this kind of leveling can more easily be accomplished by a specialty leader engaging with their community and knowing who the top runners are, so that they don't allow all the top runners to cluster at one location."198,I,8/23/16 10:22,4,en,8/23/16 10:16,8/23/16 10:22,Family Medicine,,LCDR,2015,,CONUS MTF,,2-4 months,,3,4,4,1st choice,,Southern California,Pacific Northwest,Europe,,,,,,,Resign/Retire,,No,,3 tours (~9 years),,No,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Dec-16,,Yes,Yes,"I do feel that seniority is important and I don't have trouble with their preferences being honored first.

This, combined with a loss of military GME training sites for FM, is going to create an interesting personnel shortage in the upcoming years.  A lot of those that I speak to that are getting out are frustrated with the whole process.  Messaging is inconsistent.

If O-5s and O-6s homestead in billets that are desirable and have the important leadership opportunities then the junior physicians are at a huge disadvantage for promotions. Homesteading also allows senior officers avoid the decision of retirement even if they are in their terminal rank. This is clogging the promotion system. If a 25 year O-6 has to choose between retiring or moving to Korea, they will likely choose to retire and then we won't have 40% promotion rates. The longer tour options do allow for more corporate knowledge, but also bog down the system. It is also generally understood that there is a  promotion disadvantage to physicians filling operational billets- deploying and supporting the Navy and Marine Corps mission. This is unacceptable and we will loose those officers most committed to Navy Medicine and the mission. As an O-4, once HPSP or USU commitment is paid back there is little incentive to stay in the Navy based on current billeting option and promotion rates."214,I,8/23/16 10:52,4,en,8/23/16 10:43,8/23/16 10:52,Family Medicine,,CDR,2015,,CONUS MTF,,2-4 months,,5,5,5,1st choice,,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Southern California,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Pacific Northwest,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",National Capital Region,Northeast,Europe,Middle East or Africa,Academic Medicine,,No,,Other,"depends on context; GME, EFMP, prior hx.

Additionally, the proposed system will involve a huge number of man hours each time you are up for orders.  Will there end up being an interview process?  Will locations say, ""candidate X did not come interview in person so he/she must not really want the job.""  What will people asking for extensions in a current location do?  I think the specialty leaders have a pretty good handle on what their communities need and are removed enough from most situations that I think in most billeting decisions they do a decent job.

The current promotion system (and of course billet selection system) favors those that do not move and do not take operational or training billets as they develop networks that enhance their careers among others that are not moving, which then leads to preferential selection to coveted positions.  Unless the promotion system recognizes this in some official manner, no amount of matching for billets will even this out.  Once the initial assignment after residency occurs, it is unclear how this system would be helpful to those of us in tours after fellowship or after the first utilization tour.  Additionally, it is not clear how costs would be addressed (i.e. how would coast-to-coast moves be weighted?).  There would also be many extenuating factors such as co-location and EFMP that would have to be considered which may result in very few choices for those that are left over.

There have been several times before when I know of a person who was told they were going to MTF A and I was told to go to MTF B, and we would have preferred to switch but it was not allowed as PERS felt it would be too troublesome to change the orders once written. There was no apparent EFMP or co-lo issues and we were the same rank and experience level. The have been other times when known opening billets are not advertised due to being promised or people being ""penciled in"", which reduced the impression of honesty and transparency as the reason for the billet being off the table was not apparent. All that being, said I do prefer the discussion and working together of SL and detailers as there are issues of fit, capability,  and appropriateness that would not be apparent or considered as a factor in a straight lottery process. Some people who may be willing to take a non-promoting job just to live in a location really need the right counseling to make a fully informed choice to prevent disillusionment if/when they get passed over. OCONUS and operation tours should get a nudge up for taking one for the team. I think 2 tours in general is enough, but if someone wants to extend longer at an OCONUS or hard to fill MTF,  that would be fine(again need appropriate counseling). Other higher desired spots should probably have a benefit to the Navy to stay past 6 yrs (selection to a signficant leadership position at the MTF), but 9 yrs at one location is plenty. Using a non physician detailer is probably OK, but I worry that that would reduce the detailer into a person that only cares about filling spots. The Specialty Leader should paly a big role in that case. In my discussions with three different Specialty Leaders and a few physician detailers, I think the personal touch process ultimately works better than a lottery style match to ensure the best fit for commands and providers..Then again, you never know if something new is better until you try(but thank goodness my PRD is 2018). I think rank should have some weight, but can be trumped by OCONUS, operational, or remote duty tours. I don't think self imposed geobachelor tours should have much weight. If you get detailed to a spot where you can't take a family that'd be different, but just because you go from NMCSD to 29 Palms, and geobach it because you don't want to take your family,  doesn't mean you should automatically get to go back to NMCSD.

The detailer was unresponsive to emails or phone calls. Often times going weeks between communication.

My current dept has 4/5 surgeons less than 1 year out from training, only one is board certified, and none of the surgeons is fellowship trained. There remains a problem with once a surgeon gets to a CONUS billet they stay there for their entire career which means that OCONUS billets are consistently filled by junior surgeons. This is not ideal for care of our service men and women or surgeon growth. The Navy needs to make a commitment to subspecialty training of surgeons and creating a mix of senior and junior surgeons at all billets across multiple subspecialties. Though there is a benefit to surgeon stability and allowing them to develop a practice over many years this should likely be limited to the training institutions where surgeons can develop research projects and consistently train residents for multiple years. The value of senior surgeons spending entire careers at the smaller CONUS billets is likely outweighed by the lack of seniority that provides to OCONUS billets. 
    The lack of transparency with the selection process also remains a problem. Surgeons are not provided a list of what might be available and there is certainly no formal process to rank anything. Furthermore there is limited information about who is where currently or ability to reach out and get more information about a potential billets allowing for an informed decision. Currently this is done through personal connections usually limited to where one did residency.
  I am not sure a match system would mitigate the current problems of lack of senior and subspecialty trained physicians at OCONUS billets however removing the power from the detailer and specialty leader may create more transparency and that could have value. Unless steps are taken to reduce the ability to ""homestead"" where one surgeon spends his whole career at one command we will continue to have OCONUS billets staffed by junior surgeons fresh out of training with little if any local resources for backup.

What if the match produces these results?  Also, sometimes ""problem"" physicians are sent to facilities with training programs for remediation. What if the match doesn't support/facilitate such moves?  If providers are well-liked at their command, won't a match-type system actually make it *easier* for such providers to ""homestead"" at a place?  Wouldn't a match type system take away a Specialty Leader's ability to increase retention by offering top choice billets to providers thinking of getting out?  How would a match system prioritize spousal co-locations for families with two active duty members?

No one who wants to promote under the current system would preferentially seek out these billets as their one-of-one fit reps, no matter how impressive or backed up with letters of recommendation, are not given weight at the ranking board. The Fleet and Marines will begin to see those who have no other options or match prospects sent to demanding operational and remote leadership billets, and the quality will be going to MTF's where promotion prospects are greater. We will be providing our least desirable talent to the very mission (Fleet/Marines) that we as Naval Officers should see as a first priority.

There are specific reasons that residency programs conduct a match (very large volume of both applicants and programs, dramatic power imbalance between applicants and programs, programs historically taking advantage of applicants with high-pressure ""sign with us right now"" tactics to fill positions, etc). Those reasons are generally not applicable to military physicians. Creating a match system will create instability in the senior ranks, and will adversely affect institutional subspecialty stability, research productivity/grant applications, resident training, and overall patient satisfaction/experience.

Additionally, while MTF commands are likely to engage in this process, based on my personal experience smaller and operational commands likely will not.

Finally, the ""application"" is unlikely to account for personality or clinical acumen. The residency match accounts for these issues by placing heavy weight on ""audition rotations"" lasting several weeks or a month, and through in-person interviews. The Navy is unlikely to do similar things, and will likely place heavy emphasis on information in the service record and FITREPs. But these intangible qualities of surgeons/physicians are highly important to determining ""fit"" and exactly the type of things that specialty leaders (but not boards, commanders, or a match process) can account for when determining optimal assignments.

I think junior folks in the service should at least have the discussion with specialty leaders to discuss long-term plans, receive counseling on career progression, and receive clear information about options for assignments.

While I understand the rationale for giving some level of extra consideration to dual military members, BUMED should be aware that if our (non-dual-military) careers and families are lower priority (regardless of our performance), that will impact our retention.  My wife has tremendous negative impact on her career opportunities if she wants to be co-located with me.  If anything, we should have HIGHER priority for billets, given the impact on our families.

I think a match based system would have some merits, but ultimately I am concerned that it would allow for favoritism to be made worse in certain circumstances.  If people become friends with certain commands/departments, they can arrange it so that they pick each other in the match, and this would be a set up for favoritism.   I have given a lot of thought to how to make the system more fair, and I think that a system that incorporates 3 factors would optimize fairness and transparency: 1.) Assign officers points based on their fitreps, difficult assignments, specialty/AQD, etc, which would go into their ""billet selection record"" (similar to selection board record).  2.) The Navy publishes a public list of available billets (similar to FLTMPS) and the scores needed for each job.  3.) Undesirable assignments/hardship tours would be given bonus points towards an officer's record so that they are more competitive for the next tour.  This system would allow for a match type system, but it keeps things objective and does not allow for favoritism.  The numbers are what the numbers are, and officers will know what they need to do to improve their numbers if they are not the greatest.  As a caveat, I think that it is important for detailers/specialty leaders to have ""bonus/superdelegate""points that they can add to a member's record to make them more competitive for certain types of jobs if special circumstances require it, however, this would be published publicly too with a general code for why.  I think that this system would improve many of the problems listed in this survey: it would reduce favoritism, incentivize people to move when it's appropriate (and also incentivize people to take undesirable billets/reward them for it), and improve transparency/fairness.  Thank you for this opportunity to share my views."538,I,8/25/16 16:10,4,en,8/25/16 15:59,8/25/16 16:10,Pathology,,LCDR,2016,,CONUS MTF,,> 4 months,,5,5,5,1st choice,,Southern California,Europe,National Capital Region,Pacific Northwest,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Northeast,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Middle East or Africa,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Resign/Retire,,Yes,,2 tours (~6 years),,Yes,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Jul-16,,Yes,Yes,"The Specialty Leader plays an ENORMOUS role in properly selecting individuals for billets while meeting the needs of the Navy.

A stable group of people who work well together will make greatness happen.  The best civilian hospitals in our country do not move people the way we do, so if we want to run great hospitals we need to be more mindful of these personnel decisions.  Frequent moves are not desired by most, are costly when we can't afford it, and undermine continuity of effort in many of our most important roles.

It allows the physician to strengthen their knowledge of military and local medical resources and establish themselves in the local military and civilian communities.  Understandably there are certain positions that are less desirable but I see no problem in a hierarchical system with filling them with junior/ first-tour physicians (if this is clinically appropriate) as long as it is well known within the medical community that once you ""pay your dues"" in that less ""desirable"" (which is a relative term) job that you will be afforded the opportunity to transfer to a more desirable job.

As an aside, and on a tangentially-related issue, I believe that the Navy needs to revisit the ever-growing list of pre-requisites which have become part of the promotion structure.  While leadership development is important, I feel that this culture shift has created a burdensome problem that detracts from patient care.  Limiting the scope of collateral involvement on the part of physicians would likely have the result of increasing access to care and decreasing wait times- which I know are very closely tracked metrics within Navy medicine.

Having just come from an overseas command tour at a small MTF I can speak from experience that a single difficult or less than competent provider can be a substantial issue for a small command.  Most specialty leaders have a better knowledge of their members than the gaining commands so I would like to keep the SL in the mix vs. a more algorithmic approach.    More emphasis should be put on getting both the right clinical skills as well as the right level of maturity and personality type into the right job vs. simply matching bodies to billets.  We should do this better than we do currently but I worry that taking the SL out of the mix will only make it worse.         Thoughts on tour lengths; some tours (specifically residency teaching staff) should probably be longer than 3 years.  Most others should be limited to no more than 3 or 4 years.  Folks think that staying longer in one place improves their performance but I have also seen the reverse......limiting your experience to one or two MTFs (especially if they are large ones) limits officers ability to adapt to new environments and circumstances.  In other words, spend your entire career at Portsmouth and you will struggle mightily at a small MTF.     Preference thoughts: some preference is reasonable coming from operational tours....perhaps the same from OCONUS.  Again though, more emphasis needs to be on getting that provider back into the right position vs. simple ""preference"".  I.e. coming from sleepy overseas ER?

I am sure there are drawbacks, but the Army appears to have three tracks:  Purely clinical/but does operational billets, academic, and executive.  This allows certain core people with all the credentials and qualifiers to stay at the large teaching hospitals, but they function to primarily train the residents and do research.  Executive medicine will allow people to track tpwards promotion and keep a varied career in and out of the operational forces, but have positions open to them at the MTF's to take leadership positions and not have those slide to individuals who have stayed at the MTF for years and failed to select for O-6.

Also, more education needs to be out there about career progression and functioning as an Officer in the Navy.  There are too many young physicians that spend all their time in the hospital and have no idea how the regular Navy and Marine Corps functions.  With less time deployed, these number will likely increase.  With GMO's technically going away we will have the opportunity to send residency trained physicians out to individual units which increases capability, but we will need to re-think how we structure that force to get the best use out of their training.

For example: In cardiology, we have fellowship trained(navy sponsored) interventional cardiologists who do not carry separate subspecialty billet code but they can only be stationed at an MTF with a cardiac catheterization laboratory if they are to maintain credentials/skills/board certification in that specialty.  You would not be able to send an interventional cardiologist to Okinawa or Camp Lejeune/NH Pensacola and then have the expectation that they could then practice as interventional cardiologist on STEMI call at NMC San Diego for their next billet.    Creating additional subspecialty billet codes reduces the perception of favoritism and supports why those particular specialists are tied to large MTF.  Another example would be a neonatologist, an interventional radiologist, or some of the academicians associated with training programs like neuroradiologists, Pediatric ED physicians, potentially ortho hand specialists.   Although they carry the general specialty board certification, they will lose the ability to practice their subspecialty if not placed in a center with those capabilities and you cannot get those skills back without retraining/reboarding/oversight for credentialing and in some cases you just cannot get the credentials/board certification back after interruption to practice. Discussions are had about outsourcing these specialists to civilian care who are difficult to deploy and PCS to smaller MTFs/overseas assignment, but my understanding is the cost analysis of purchasing subspecialty care for on call 24-7 STEMI interventional cardiologists is prohibitive and that recruitment is poor as very few interventional cardiologists want to take a job at a lower volume center with high call requirements (1:2 call).   For this reason there are limitations not seen on paper in placing specialists in various locations and having a computer do the match or a non-physician without understanding of those requirements would lead to placing these specialists in locations where their usefulness becomes obsolete prior to the next PCS move."684,I,8/29/16 19:43,4,en,8/29/16 19:31,8/29/16 19:43,Occupational Medicine,,CDR,2013,,CONUS Operational,,2-4 months,,4,4,4,1st choice,,Southern California,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Pacific Northwest,National Capital Region,Europe,Northeast,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)","Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Middle East or Africa,Mixed,,No,,2 tours (~6 years),,Yes,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Feb-17,,No,,"I have been happy with all 8 duty assignments I have received and with the detailing process.

As far as academic assignments go- I think we need to ensure the needs of the academic program come first! I.e. San Diego should not be an award for a Captain, even if that Captain had a spectacular career. You should only get to be at the academic center if you are adding value to the residency program. Additionally, I feel very strongly that we need keep some Active Duty at the teaching programs more than one set of orders (3 years). Of that 3 years, one year can almost certainly be gone due to operational assignments/deployments. This then takes the orders down to 2 years. It's very, very hard to gain any traction on research projects with this time frame. Our academic programs need more continuity.

If you jumped on a deployment then that should count when you are compared to folks who are ducking them or haven't deployed.  If you took a job no one wanted when you got out of residency then you should get more consideration when it comes time for your next job.  Also, If you are performing well at a command and they like you then why not let people stay, it makes everyone happier, including the patients.  Along those lines, it is troubling to me that there is inequality in who gets to stay in positions, some CO's like to keep people while others seem to be threatened by senior docs who are trying to homestead in places that are running well   People have been moved in the last year just because a CO doesn't like to let people stay longer than 3 years and its costs us surgeons.  I get if someone is a problem but why otherwise is it an issue?  Because the rest of the Navy does it that way is a tired reason.  I also think that billet assignments should be considered with a senior + junior mix or mentor consideration, there are smaller commands that are getting all junior docs because they are smaller commands.  These commands are often getting all young docs and the docs aren't getting much mentorship in their careers, this affects patient care, retention, and promotions."709,I,8/31/16 9:30,4,en,8/31/16 9:01,8/31/16 9:30,Neonatology,,CDR,2014,,CONUS MTF,,> 4 months,,4,4,1,1st choice,,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Southern California,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",National Capital Region,,,,,,Resign/Retire,,Do not care,,2 tours (~6 years),,Yes,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Jan-17,,No,Yes,"I think people are using the EFMP status to ""game the system"" and not move.

There is favoritism that I have seen over the years and anyway to change that would be appreciated.  I have one more orders prior to retirement and feel nervous about getting these orders.

For this reason, I feel the current process with heavy input required from the specialty leader (and program director for recent graduates) is critical for getting the right people to the right billets.

I believe we have a system that works yet we need to hold ourselves accountable to ensuring it works in the most professional manner."731,I,9/1/16 16:38,4,en,9/1/16 16:31,9/1/16 16:38,General Surgery,,LT,Other, IRR in NAADS since 2011,GME,,Other,No orders,5,5,,2nd choice,,Pacific Northwest,Southern California,National Capital Region,Europe,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Middle East or Africa,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Northeast,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Academic Medicine,,No,,3 tours (~9 years),,No,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Nov-16,,Yes,Yes,"With regard to the GME billets, at least in the case of surgical residencies the interviews are moving earlier and earlier in the match process, so it might be reasonable to consider moving the military match day forward.  This would still allow the committee to assess the competitiveness of applicants based on the number of interviews offered in the civilian match, but for residents who do not receive deferment time for them to cancel interviews and thus not defer that cost. 

Lastly, I had no idea that the USAF and USA do not use physician detailers, I think it speaks to the commitment of the Navy toward retaining good physicians that the USN uses physicians in this role.

This is particularly critical in a high risk specialty such as OBGYN."1204,I,9/12/16 12:02,4,en,9/12/16 11:56,9/12/16 12:02,OB/GYN,,LCDR,2016,,CONUS MTF,,2-4 months,,4,4,4,3rd choice,,Southern California,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Pacific Northwest,Europe,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)","Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Middle East or Africa,Northeast,National Capital Region,Executive Medicine,,No,,2 tours (~6 years),,Yes,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Dec-16,,Yes,,822,I,9/1/16 17:24,4,en,9/1/16 17:19,9/1/16 17:24,Resident,,LT,2014,,GME,,2-4 months,,4,4,4,1st choice,,Southern California,Middle East or Africa,Europe,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",National Capital Region,Pacific Northwest,Northeast,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)","Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Operational Medicine,,No,,3 tours (~9 years),,No,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Jan-17,,Yes,Yes,1206,I,9/12/16 12:09,4,en,9/12/16 11:59,9/12/16 12:09,OB/GYN,,CDR,2014,,CONUS MTF,,2-4 months,,5,5,5,1st choice,,Southern California,Pacific Northwest,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",National Capital Region,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Northeast,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Europe,Middle East or Africa,Mixed,,No,,Other,Depends on the needs.

At the same time, some people have specialized experience and qualifications which they may be better able to utilize at certain locations and consequently improve medicine on a broader scale.

No ideal solution to deal with the overseas problem.  Other medical problem is that to advance in the military, you have to do a leadership billet and operational billet (ie, admin). This means less clinical time, which affects access to care, and reduces patient satisfaction.  In other words, military physicians are expected to do too much non clinical work to promote; the system should reward those who do good clinical work and practice good medicine rather than those who write the best policies.

If you get orders <90 days- you are in a time crunch.  Clinics/patients need to operate and be seen. To get these things done you need adequate amount of time to do so. 
Nothing moves forward until orders so there are 2nd/3rd order effects.  This creates major stressors on families that are unnecessary. It increases costs by millions of dollars across the Navy.
This is not new- so why does it seem we reinvent the wheel every time.

2. Detailing in OBGYN has improved significantly.  However, there are people sitting in billets for years which keeps others from moving and making rank. i.e. NMCSD.  This is why we have GS working there- they have the corporate knowledge.  You have people in leadership positions for 6-10 years and more and people can't move up in their careers.  Especially the specialists who actually don t have enough demand to keep all of them there.  These people can be detailed across the MSMs.
I have no clue how people get detailed.  It has worked well for me but I have been willing to move or go TAD when requested. Not so for many others.

3. Tours- people should be allowed to stay as long as no one is trying to get into the position.  If they are EFMP, then does that truly meet the mission of the Navy/MHS.  Because once again that person is interrupting the movement of others.  Everyone has family needs.  If EFMP is inhibiting that military members movement then they should either go GEO bachelor (navy should be willing to pay their dual BAS since it's likely cheaper) or be offered early retirement (if w/in 5 years of retirement) or resign from the military.

4. The more you take human factors out of the match the better.  Then there is less room for favoritism and there is increased transparency.  There should be a detailing map.  All MTFs should have Senior/Midlevel/Junior staff.  The days of sending recent graduates to small/midsize commands without mentorship/leadership (I'm not talking seniority only but true experience) should be over.  This is not the standard of care and increased patient safety issues.  Also, when you have experienced providers with inexperienced support staff or colleagues this increases patient/provider safety risks as well.

5. Members with seniority: If that member has willingly done what the Navy requires- PCSd/TAD/is a SME in their field or a master clinician then yes they should be able to stay.  If they are meeting expectation but not exceeding then move them.  If they don't meet expectation retire/get out. We don't need anyone less than the best.  Sometimes people are just getting by.

6. Medical is not executive.  If you want clinicians then hire and promote them for their clinical skills.  There will be a few who want to be executives , so allow that. For those who do not- then place HCAs as department heads and directors.  If you want the best for patients allow clinicians/nurses to practice their craft and keep that as an expectation.

Additionally, just because someone wants to go somewhere doesn't make that a good decision.  Individuals need to be pushed to take positions of greater responsibility; MTF's need a mix of senior and junior personnel; some doctors aren't a good fit for a teaching program; some doctors are coming off an operational tour and need to get to a high volume destination for skills refreshment; for some doctors, it's their ""turn"" to take the undesirable billet.  A better strategy would be to develop consistent placement/detailing guidelines for everyone to use.  I was recently a specialty leader and received little turnover from my predecessor about the process.  Over time, other than some BUPERS guidance on EFMP and co-lo, much of the placement was based on the experience and good sense of the SL and Detailer.  Further, these guidelines could be sent out to all doctors so that everyone knows what's coming.  The details would need modifications to the needs of the community (Gen Surg, ER, and Anesthesia have a higher frequency operational assignment than IM or Ophtho; FM covers many more locations than most other specialties).   Development of these guidelines should involve the SL's, chairs of major departments, GME representatives, as well as SME's on Career Development."1229,I,9/12/16 14:23,4,en,9/12/16 14:19,9/12/16 14:23,OB/GYN,,LT,2014,,GME,,> 4 months,,5,5,1,1st choice,,National Capital Region,Southern California,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)","Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Pacific Northwest,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Northeast,Europe,Middle East or Africa,Academic Medicine,,No,,2 tours (~6 years),,No,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Dec-16,,Yes,Yes,1230,I,9/12/16 14:42,4,en,9/12/16 14:19,9/12/16 14:42,Neurosurgery,,LCDR,2014,,CONUS MTF,,2-4 months,,3,3,3,1st choice,,National Capital Region,Southern California,Pacific Northwest,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Europe,Northeast,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)","Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Middle East or Africa,Academic Medicine,,No,,2 tours (~6 years),,No,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Jun-16,,,,No.1231,I,9/12/16 15:36,4,en,9/12/16 15:22,9/12/16 15:36,OB/GYN,,LCDR,2016,,CONUS MTF,,2-4 months,,5,5,5,1st choice,,Southern California,,,,,,,,,Clinical Medicine,,Yes,,2 tours (~6 years),,No,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Dec-16,,,,1232,I,9/12/16 15:27,4,en,9/12/16 15:23,9/12/16 15:27,Otolaryngology,,LCDR,2015,,CONUS MTF,,2-4 months,,2,3,5,1st choice,,Southern California,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Europe,Pacific Northwest,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)","Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",National Capital Region,Northeast,Middle East or Africa,Clinical Medicine,,No,,2 tours (~6 years),,No,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Dec-16,,Yes,Yes,1233,I,9/12/16 16:09,4,en,9/12/16 16:04,9/12/16 16:09,Neurosurgery,,CDR,2015,,CONUS MTF,,2-4 months,,5,5,5,1st choice,,Southern California,National Capital Region,,,,,,,,Academic Medicine,,No,,Other,As long as they are advancing and productive,No,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Jan-17,,No,Yes,"Neurosurgery is a small portion of the MC, so my comments would be hard to generalize.

The issue with the match concept is there are locations that people do not want to go.  Therefore will not be ranked. Most of these must be filled according to the needs of the Navy.  Therefore someone is going to be designated to go to these locations.  A modification of the current system that makes why decisions were made.  Needs of the Navy, EFMP, Limited duty, collateral duties etc would be more beneficial than a complete overhaul which does by limited description end the I am still forced to go to billet I don't want, because it will still happen.  Additionally when the selection is released is not as important as when the orders are released.  It is extremely difficult to arrange PCS, household goods shipments, travel, etc with minimal time and final orders.  Most processes with HHG etc take 90-180 days minimum and that is if everything runs smoothly.  Which most of the time it does not.  So releasing orders will be more important that releasing the selections.

For instance, there are complex social issues, financial issues with members, career preferences, GME considerations, and skill sets need to be appropriately scoped. There may be personality conflicts or degrees of experience which need to be considered or paired. These are things a computer cannot do well. On another note, generally keeping people in one location is a good thing for surgeons and families its helps with continuity, social and financial. However, I would also like to say that I do not agree with the Navy's policy of ""locking"" someone into a billet because they are co-located with their military spouse. Moving a family with two military spouses is (for them) just a fun change of scenery AND saves the military money (two for the price of one); whereas when a physician whose spouse is a civilian is moved this is a major nuclear bomb on their lives socially, professionally (for the civilian spouse) and financially. A civilian spouse is usually unable to establish a career which is extremely disadvantageous due to the moves. I think ""dual"" military spouses should be the first time be moved, rather than being ""locked"" as is currently the case.  These dual military couples are usually very financially ""well-off"" compared to their ""military-married-to-civilian"" counterparts from years of dual professional level income."1245,I,9/12/16 18:48,4,en,9/12/16 18:44,9/12/16 18:48,OB/GYN,,LT,2016,,CONUS MTF,,> 4 months,,3,4,5,1st choice,,National Capital Region,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)","Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Europe,Southern California,Pacific Northwest,Northeast,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Middle East or Africa,Academic Medicine,,No,,4 tours (~12 years),,No,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Dec-16,,No,Yes,1246,I,9/13/16 0:18,4,en,9/12/16 18:50,9/13/16 0:18,OB/GYN,,LCDR,2015,,OCONUS MTF,,> 4 months,,4,4,4,1st choice,,Pacific Northwest,Europe,Southern California,,,,,,,Clinical Medicine,,No,,2 tours (~6 years),,Yes,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Dec-16,,Yes,Yes,1061,I,9/6/16 14:48,4,en,9/6/16 14:44,9/6/16 14:48,Resident,,LT,2012,,GME,,> 4 months,,,,,1st choice,,Southern California,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Pacific Northwest,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Northeast,National Capital Region,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Europe,Middle East or Africa,Clinical Medicine,,Do not care,,2 tours (~6 years),,No,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Dec-16,,No,Yes,1248,I,,1,en,9/12/16 19:15,9/12/16 19:15,OB/GYN,,LT,2016,,GME,,2-4 months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1249,I,9/12/16 20:36,4,en,9/12/16 19:40,9/12/16 20:36,Internal Medicine (General),,LT,2016,,GME,,2-4 months,,4,4,,1st choice,,National Capital Region,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Northeast,Pacific Northwest,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Southern California,Europe,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Middle East or Africa,Academic Medicine,,No,,Other,career length if they so choose,No,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Jan-17,,Yes,No,1250,I,9/12/16 20:02,4,en,9/12/16 19:44,9/12/16 20:02,OB/GYN,,CDR,2016,,OCONUS Operational,,< 1 month,,5,3,1,1st choice,,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)","Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Northeast,Europe,Southern California,Pacific Northwest,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",National Capital Region,Middle East or Africa,Clinical Medicine,,Yes,,2 tours (~6 years),,Yes,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Dec-16,,Yes,Yes,"For years we have seen the time between when you are ""told where you are going"" and when you actually receive orders decrease.

Using a match system would also make it more challenging to ensure appropriate options for leadership positions like Dept Head unless there were a separate match process for that as well."103,I,,3,en,8/21/16 10:26,8/21/16 10:44,Undersea Medicine,,LT,2015,,CONUS Operational,,< 1 month,,2,5,4,1st choice,,Northeast,Europe,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)","Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)","Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",National Capital Region,Southern California,Pacific Northwest,Middle East or Africa,Clinical Medicine,,Do not care,,4 tours (~12 years),,No,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Jan-17,,Yes,Yes,1287,I,9/13/16 14:06,4,en,9/13/16 14:01,9/13/16 14:06,Family Medicine,,CAPT or Flag,2016,,OCONUS Operational,,< 1 month,,1,5,1,2nd choice,,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Southern California,Pacific Northwest,National Capital Region,Northeast,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)","Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Europe,Middle East or Africa,Executive Medicine,,Yes,,1 tour (~3 years),,Yes,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Jan-17,,Yes,Yes,1288,I,9/13/16 14:15,4,en,9/13/16 14:09,9/13/16 14:15,OB/GYN,,LT,2016,,GME,,2-4 months,,4,4,3,2nd choice,,Southern California,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Pacific Northwest,Europe,National Capital Region,Northeast,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)","Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Middle East or Africa,Clinical Medicine,,Do not care,,2 tours (~6 years),,Yes,,Something similar to the National Residency Match Program,,Mar-17,,Yes,Yes,1289,I,9/13/16 14:39,4,en,9/13/16 14:33,9/13/16 14:39,Family Medicine,,CAPT or Flag,2015,,CONUS Operational,,2-4 months,,3,3,3,2nd choice,,Southern California,Europe,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)","Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Pacific Northwest,National Capital Region,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",Northeast,Middle East or Africa,Executive Medicine,,No,,4 tours (~12 years),,No,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Dec-16,,Yes,Yes,239,I,8/23/16 12:45,4,en,8/23/16 12:36,8/23/16 12:45,Undersea Medicine,,CAPT or Flag,2014,,OCONUS Operational,,2-4 months,,2,2,2,Other,Only billet offered,Europe,"Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, Japan)",Pacific Northwest,"Southeast (North Carolina, Florida)",Northeast,Southern California,"Tidewater Region (Portsmouth, Norfolk)",National Capital Region,Middle East or Africa,Operational Medicine,,No,,2 tours (~6 years),,Yes,,Status Quo: Detailer and Specialty Leader decide,,Feb-17,,No,No,"There are too many ""indispensable"" senior MOs who avoid important operational and overseas assignments, leading to filling these billets with inexperienced junior officers and increasing operational risk.

",Other,"There is a different between residency match and career development.  In the civilian sector if I want to teach then I will look for an academic facility - that doesn't limit the locations except perhaps to larger cities.  Within the Navy system - you can only teach at the 'big 3' and we haven't put a priority on identifying those who are interested in and have added skill or education in teaching.  It ends up being ""who is senior enough to get their first choice"".  That system hurts both the learner and the junior faculty.  ",Feb-17,,,,"I think we are asking the wrong questions.  Rather than ask 'why do you think the current process is unfair' - perhaps ask - 'what does your ideal billet look like this year, in 5 yrs, in 15 yrs' - then figure out the gap.  Most of us (I think) are less worried about moving than we are about going to an environment where we have less than what we need to grow personally and professionally.  Certainly there are people who have homesteaded - but then the question is ""what in that environment made it ideal"" then figure out how to fix those things in the 'non-ideal' environments.   It will in some cases be schools or a house that they can't sell - in which case - support folks financially enough that they don't lose money in the move or have to risk a poorer educational environment for their kids.  In other cases it will be spouse career limitations - so figure out ways to support the spouses.  In others it will be having faculty positions or leadership opportunities or specific support at their hospital for xyz procedure, or having a large population of xyz patients, or whatever.  Our people are worth figuring out what makes these ""non-ideal"" billets 'non-ideal' and fixing those issues rather than forcing everyone into an algorithm that will just serve to make everyone a little more miserable and be just one more item that folks put on their ""reasons I hate my job"" list.
